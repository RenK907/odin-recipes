    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        This classic grilled cheese sandwich recipe calls for just white bread, sliced <br>
        cheese, and butter. It's easy to switch up the bread and cheese to suit your taste <br>
        preferences and, if you like, you can substitute mayonnaise for butter. 
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices white bread.</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided.</li>
        <li>2 slices Cheddar cheese.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one side of a <br>
            slice of bread. Place bread butter-side down in the hot skillet; add 1 slice <br>
            of cheese. Butter a second slice of bread on one side and place butter-side up on <br>
            top of cheese. </li>
        <li>Cook until lightly browned on one side; flip over and continue cooking until <br>
            cheese is melted. Repeat with remaining 2 slices of bread, butter, and slice of <br>
            cheese. </li>           
    </ol>
