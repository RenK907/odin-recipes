    <h2 class="title heading">Description:</h2>
    <p>Candied Yams are a mainstay in many thanksgiving meals. Sweet and savory, <br>
        they tend to appeal to just about everyone while being relatively easy <br>
        to make.</p>

    <p>Of note, many will interchangeably call them Sweet Potatoes. While there <br>
        is a difference in the actual plant, for this recipe we use cans <br>
        containing sweet potatoes usually labeled as yams.</p>

    <h2 class="title heading">Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul class="ingredient-list">
        <li>1 (29 ounce) can sweet potatoes, drained.</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>½ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups miniature marshmallows</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="title heading">Steps:</h2>
    <ol class="instruction-list">
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place <strong>drained</strong> sweet potatoes in a medium baking dish. Distribute <br>
        butter pieces evenly over the sweet potatoes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with brown sugar. Layer with mini marshmallows.</li>
