Odin Project Recipes project

This project is to show use of basic html to make a super basic website.
will demonstrate basic understanding of tag structure, use of image
tags, and so on.

Note, this is not really my first website, but I am going through the basics
again as it has been years since I really got into it. I need the
refresher as the last time I regularly used html, HTML5 wasn't even a thing. 
Also a good way to learn git from the ground up as I've never seriously used it
beyond a few pet projects almost ten years ago.

2025 Update:

After a bit away from following The Odin Project I am getting back into it again and trying to be a it more serious this time. Making this edit to compliment the CSS changes the course asks us to make during the CSS portion of the foundations course. Also some spelling fixes :P
